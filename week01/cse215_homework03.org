* Exercise 1 (score = 10)
Construct the truth table for the following statement forms:

1. false \/ p 
2. True /\ p

   
* Exercise 2 (score = 30)

Write truth tables for the following statement  forms.

1. p -> q
2. ~p \/ q
3. q -> p
4. ~q \/ p
5. ~q -> ~p
6. ~p -> ~q             

* Exercise 3   (score = 25)
   
Find at least five pairs of   statement forms above that are equivalent?



* Exercise 4 (score = 10)
   
Let x be a particular integer. Use De Morgan’s laws to write negations for the following

1. 0 < x < 10
2. x < 2 or x > 5
3. x <= 0 or x >=1 
4. 0 > x >= −7



* Exercise 5 (score = 15)
For each  statement form below, use laws of logical equivalence to determine  if it is a tautology or contradiction. Explain which laws you are applying to  get your results. 

1.  (∼p\/q)\/(p/\∼q)
2. (p/\∼q)∧(∼p\/q)
3. (p/\q)\/(∼p\/(p/\∼q))  


* Exercise 6. (score = 10)

  Check if the two statement forms below are logically equivalent and argue why

-  p \/ q -> r
- (p -> r) /\ (q ->r)
